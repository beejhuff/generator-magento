# Generator Magento

A generator for Magento.

## Note

This is very early in it's development, not recommended for public use yet. At the moment it's a
project for me to get into writing generators with yeoman.

## Getting started
- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-magento`
- Run: `yo magento`

## TODO

 - Give option to install EcomDev_PHPUnit module
 - Use a base .gitignore file
 - Run magento installation
